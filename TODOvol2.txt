refactor and merge code because its repetitive.

when user has an unobtained certificate, needs to be able to give exams

when user has an obtained certificate, needs to be able to print it in pdf format

price isnt updated, why? maybe because of type? sometimes its working,idk

SOS, when updating an existing certificates, its being accepted only if all the fields are not null

see if i can merge custom hooks
